# Rival Caliburn Nerf Gun

This was a fun project just to put something together from someone else's design. The parts are by [captainslug](http://www.captainslug.com/), and I ordered the springs and barrel parts from his Etsy shop. It was a ton of fun to put together, and it works surprisingly well over ~30 feet.

The 20 3D printed parts took a few weeks to get done, and some of them needed different densities of material, so it took some trial and error. I tried to use a separate material - ABS - for some of the parts that needed more durability, but neither printer I have currently could handle it well.
