# Notes

Notes Fabric is a Fabric mod made for Minecraft 1.15.2-1.18.1, which allows you to take notes in-game (or externally) and save them per-world, per-server, or globally. It's a port of the forge mod of the same name, Notes, and has racked up 2.4M downloads as of writing. 

Unfortunately the source code was lost when I was moving off my old laptop, so the last version will be 1.18.1.

It can be found on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notes-fabric).
