    Hi! I'm a student studying the field of software engineering
and I have a passion for making things. Whether itâ€™s: a
utility program to sort my indie games found scattered
across the internet, a bot that tracks my Skyblock coin
balance, or making cool looking graphs in Minecraft, I am
always teaching myself something new and learning more.
</p>

<h2>Favorite Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://reeve.dev/posts/dungeon_crawler/">Dungeon Crawler</a> - This was one of my favorite projects to work on, and it spurred a little bit of obsession over mazes later on</li>
<li><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/notes-fabric">Notes Fabric</a> - This was a port of the Notes mod that I made, trying to imitate it almost exactly, since the original was only on Forge.
It was a labor of love, but I ended up losing the source and never had the ambition to remake it.
You can find out more about that <a href="https://reeve.dev/posts/notes/">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/reeve567/CustomEnchants">Custom Enchants</a> - Although it's quite old, (the original source was from over 6 years ago) this project was what made me realize that I really enjoy programming.
It was a fun kind of puzzle that I didn't know all the answer to, but they were all within my reach. I read a really awesome book called Effective Java (2nd ed.) by Joshua Bloch that taught me a lot of different methods of doing things, and really taught me most of the Java I know.</li>
</ul>
