    Hi! I'm a student studying the field of software engineering
and I have a passion for making things. Whether it’s: a
utility program to sort my indie games found scattered
across the internet, a bot that tracks my Skyblock coin
balance, or making cool looking graphs in Minecraft, I am
always teaching myself something new and learning more. A
more recent project I have been working on is a turret that
I am designing from scratch using Autodesk software, a 3D
printer, some simple soldering, and C++.
</p>

    I started playing the online gaming platform, Roblox, 11
years ago, at the start of 2010. This was when my love for
sandbox games first began. Although I mainly just played
other player’s games at the time, it was still tons of fun
to load up other people’s models and scripts and mess around
on occasion. During 2011, I stumbled across a few inspiring
Minecraft building timelapse videos. The main channel I
watched was FyreUK, and I was fascinated with the idea of
being able to pick up anything and place it anywhere else.
This, plus the fact that there was a generated landscape to
build on changed everything for me. A video of a Dwarven
city built on the side of a cliff convinced me to finally
get the game, and that’s when I fell down the rabbit hole.
Minecraft has been a game that I have always come back to.

    I didn’t learn to code until later on, but that didn’t stop
me from loving the freedom plugins allowed me to have on a
Bukkit server. This led me to make a long line of servers
which gradually got better over the course of 9 years, until
it reached the point where I started to create all the
plugins I needed by my own hand. My most successful server
was one of the last ones I made, which was around 4 years
ago. On
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CVdCgireY4">this</a>
server, I shared ownership with two other friends, but I
solely developed while they used their Youtube following to
promote the server. For the duration that it lasted, we had
an active player base of around 20 players concurrently
during most times of the day. I really enjoyed closely
interacting with the community (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYGJIKZB4ic">my favorite event</a>), and to this day some of the former players still message
me occasionally to chat.
